//Strings are a data type in JavaScript. In short, they are bits of text written inside of quotation marks. You can use either single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) as quotation marks to wrap a string, as long as the opening and closing symbols match. They are particularly useful for any data or value that can be represented as plain text.


// Challenge
// 1. declare a variable mySingleString with single quotes ('), and set it's value to any string you like.

// 2.  declare a variable myDoubleString with double quotes ("'), and set it's value to any string you like.

// 3. declare a variable myBackString with backticks (`), and set it's value to any string you like.

// Uncomment the lines below to see examples of strings
// console.log('A string can be written inside of single quotes.');
// console.log("It can also be written inside of double quotes.");
// console.log(`Backticks work, too.`);

// ADD CODE BELOW




// Uncomment the line below to check your work!
// console.log(mySingleString);
// console.log(myDoubleString);
// console.log(myBackString);
