# Function Expressions

In this exercise, you will be writing some functions and function expressions, to manage the student enrollment records for a workshop.

**Note:** The spirit of this exercise is to use functions wherever possible and appropriate, so consider usage of array utilities `map(..)`, `find(..)`, `sort(..)`, and `forEach(..)`.

## Instructions (Part 1)

**Note:** In Part 1, use only function declarations or named function expressions.

You are provided onefunctions stubs -- `printRecords(..)` -- which you must define.

At the bottom of the file you will see these functions called, and a code comment indicating what the console output should be.

1. `printRecords(..)` should:
	- take a list of student Ids
	- retrieve each student record by its student Id (hint: array `find(..)`)
	- sort by student name, ascending (hint: array `sort(..)`)
	- print each record to the console, including `name`, `id`, and `"Paid"` or `"Not Paid"` based on their paid status
  
  ## Instructions (Part 2)

Now that you've completed Part 1, refactor to use **only** `=>` arrow functions.

For `printRecords(..)`,assign these arrow functions to variables of such names, so that the execution still works.

As the appeal of `=>` arrow functions is their conciseness, wherever possible try to use only expression bodies (`x => x.id`) instead of full function bodies (`x => { return x.id; }`).
